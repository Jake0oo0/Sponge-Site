          Small Status Update - 10 October, 2014

        Hello everyone,

        Second Update - We aim to have the API itself ready for developers to work on plugins in November. The official Forge-based implementation has no ETA at this time.

        This is just a quick update on the current progress of Sponge.

        As you may have noticed, the work on Sponge has slowed considerably over the past few weeks. Whilst we did aim to get the project out as soon as possible, we have hit a few partially expected delays.

      %h2{style: "margin-top: 50px;"} What is Sponge?
      %blockquote{style: "margin-bottom: 0px;"}
        %p Sponge is a server and client modding API built on top of the current Forge API.

        %p Based on various community created APIs, including Glowstone, Canary, Spout, and others, Sponge will aim to be the future of Minecraft server modding.

        %p Anyone is invited to help out in any way that they can!
