        We’re almost halfway through November already. We promised to have the API in a workable condition by November, and we’re keeping to it. Most of our issues lately have been centered around what we consider to be a lack of transparency. So to address these issues, we wanted to make these announcements!

        We have a Wiki!
        %br
        After a couple of months of furiously poking our Sysadmins, we finally have a wiki! This means that we can finally begin phasing out those sticky threads and implement a far more centralised and up-to-date repository of information.

      %h2{style: "margin-top: 50px;"} What is Sponge?
      %blockquote{style: "margin-bottom: 0px;"}
        %p Sponge is a community created and community run server, without the licensing problems of former projects.

        %p While Sponge will not be directly supporting Bukkit, community projects have been started that aim to provide complete support for existing Bukkit plugins on top of Sponge.

        %p Our ultimate goal is to create a modding API that is easy to use for owners of small servers for friends and family, owners of large servers, and everyone in between.

        %p
          Sponge is currently looking for background with former projects and Java in general, apply
