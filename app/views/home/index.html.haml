        Phew, it’s been a very busy week, we’ve been doing a heap of work across all aspects of Sponge, check it out below:

        General Update
        %br
        As you may already know, our two initial releases of Sponge will be for Forge and later for Glowstone. We were hoping to release the Sponge for Forge version earlier, but recent events (Microsoft’s acquisition of Mojang, the departure of one of Forge’s lead developers, the great number of changes in MC 1.8) had delayed the progress of Forge significantly.

      %h2{style: "margin-top: 50px;"} What is Sponge?
      %blockquote{style: "margin-bottom: 0px;"}
        %p Sponge is a community created and community run server, without the licensing problems of former projects.

        %p While Sponge will not be directly supporting Bukkit, community projects have been started that aim to provide complete support for existing Bukkit plugins on top of Sponge.

        %p Our ultimate goal is to create a modding API that is easy to use for owners of small servers for friends and family, owners of large servers, and everyone in between.

        %p 
          Sponge is currently looking for background with former projects and Java in general, apply
