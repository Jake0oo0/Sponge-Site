        Things have been busy for the Sponge team recently; with both Project Leads gone for personal reasons, and staff changes. @blood will continue to be gone for the next few weeks to tend to his family and his new child! However @sk89q has recently returned.

      %h2{style: "margin-top: 50px;"} What is Sponge?
      %blockquote{style: "margin-bottom: 0px;"}
        %p Sponge is a server and client modding API built on top of the current Forge API.

        %p Based on various community created APIs, including Glowstone, Canary, Spout, and others, Sponge will aim to be the future of Minecraft server modding.

        %p Anyone is invited to help out in any way that they can!
